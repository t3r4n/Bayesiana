Analysis of Accommodation Preferences in the Canary Islands: A Comparison between Tourist
accommodation and Hotels
This study analyzes tourist accommodation preferences in
the Canary Islands, focusing on the competition between
shared economy platforms like Airbnb and traditional hotels. Using data from the 2024 Canary Islands Tourist
Spending Survey, a Bayesian hierarchical model was applied to explore the influence of demographic, economic,
and behavioral factors on accommodation choices. The results indicate that longer stays and digital channels significantly favor tourist accommodations, while price sensitivity
and perceived accommodation quality are decisive for hotel preference. Nationality also plays a critical role, highlighting cultural and economic variations across countries.
These findings provide a solid foundation for developing
strategies tailored to touristsâ€™ needs and preferences, enhancing the competitiveness of the sector.
